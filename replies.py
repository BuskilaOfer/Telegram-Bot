question1 = "What is Blockchain"
answer1 = "A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data.\n \n Blockchain a public ledger or a distributed database of all bitcoin transactions. It is an open-source technology, information is immutable and anyone can access the details at any time. As Blockchain is a distributed ledger, there will be no control or central authority of records stored."

question2 = "What is blockchain software"
answer2 = '''Blockchain software is like any other software. The first of its kind was Bitcoin, which was released as open source software, making it available to anyone to use or change. 
            There are a wide variety of efforts across the blockchain ecosystem to improve upon Bitcoin’s original software. 
            '''

question3 ="What Is A Private Blockchain"
answer3 = "Private blockchains are deployed either within an organization or shared among a known group of participants. They can be limited to a predefined set of participants. In this case, no one else can access them or the data residing in them. "

question4 = "What Is A Smart Contract"
answer4 = "A Smart Contract is code that is deployed to the blockchain. Each smart contract contains code that can have a predefined set of inputs. Smart contracts can also store data. Following the distributed model of the blockchain, smart contracts run on every node in this technology, and each contract’s data is stored in every node. This data can be queried at any time. "

question5 = "What is Mining"
answer5 = "Mining is used a proof of work for participants in the blockchain. Whenever a block of transactions is to be agreed, every participating node attempts to ‘mine’ the block (a mathematical algorithmic process that requires extensive CPU capacity). In public blockchains successful mining is rewarded with a cryptocurrency token."

question6 = "How does a blockchain work"
answer6 = "When a digital transaction occurs in a blockchain network, it is grouped together in a cryptographically-secure “block” with other transactions that have occurred in the same time frame. The block is then broadcast to the network. \n A blockchain network is comprised of nodes or participants who validate and relay transaction information.\n The block of transactions is verified by participants called miners, who use computing power to solve a cryptographic puzzle and validate the block of transactions."

question7 = "What is a blockchain application"
answer7 = "Blockchain applications are comparable to conventional software applications, except they implement a decentralized architecture and cryptoeconomic systems to increase security, foster trust, tokenize assets, and design new network incentives. Here are over 90 Ethereum apps that are currently being used across the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, from prediction markets to smart legal agreements."

question8 = "What are the benefits of blockchain technology"
answer8 = "Blockchain technology has a wide variety of benefits, for both global enterprises and local communities. The most commonly cited benefits of a blockchain are trusted data coordination, attack-resistance, shared IT infrastructure, tokenization, and built-in incentivization."

question9 = "What is the blockchain revolution"
answer9 = "Blockchain is considered a disruptive technology because of its ability to safeguard personal information, reduce intermediaries, unlock digital assets, and potentially open up the global economy to millions more participants. Sometimes called the Trust Machine, blockchain technology is bringing transparency and security to digital networks across countless industries. In many ways, the blockchain revolution can be considered a revolution in trust."

question10 = "What is decentralized finance"
answer10 = '''Decentralized finance—often called DeFi or open finance—refers to the economic paradigm shift enabled by decentralized technologies,
 particularly blockchain networks. DeFi signals the shift from a historically centralized and closed financial system 
 toward a universally accessible economy that is based on open protocols that are interoperable, programmable,
  and composable. \n From streamlined and secure payment networks to automated loans to USD-pegged stablecoins, 
  decentralized finance has emerged as one of the most active sectors in the blockchain space. Some of the defining 
  factors of a DeFi application include permissionless architecture (anyone can participate), transparent and auditable code,
   and interoperability with other DeFi products. \n DeFi Score offers a single, consistently comparable value for measuring 
   DeFi platform risk.'''

question11 = "What is a block in a blockchain"
answer11 = ''' 
            The “block” in a blockchain refers to a block of transactions that has been broadcast to the network. 
            The “chain” refers to a string of these blocks. When a new block of transactions is validated by the network, 
            it is attached to the end of an existing chain. This chain of blocks is an ever-growing ledger of transactions 
            that the network has validated. We call this single, agreed-upon history of transactions a blockchain. 
            Only one block can exist at a given chain height. There are several ways to add new blocks to an existing chain. 
            These are often termed “proofs,” i.e. Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Proof of Authority (PoA). 
            All involve cryptographic algorithms with varying degrees of complexity.
            '''

question12 = "What is a blockchain wallet"
answer12 = "A blockchain wallet contains the public key for others to transfer cryptocurrency to your address and the private key so you can securely access your own digital assets. A blockchain wallet usually accompanies node hosting and stores cryptocurrencies on your computer. The safest place for storing digital assets is offline, what is often called 'cold storage.'"

question13 = "How Blockchain Can Be Used In Businesses"
answer13 = "By eliminating the middleman, Blockchain permits the secure sharing of business processes like business activities, records and contracts between firms and partners in an encrypted manner. Blockchain Uses cryptography principle to store the data which are impossible to hack, duplicate and misuse. \n The Transactions will be done on multiple computers in a chain, hence the records are very difficult to alter."

question14 = "What are the Types of Blockchain"
answer14 = '''
<b>1. Public Blockchain</b> - It is a decentralized Open Source platform where anyone who has the internet connection can become a part of the blockchain network and can access current and past records and verify transactions. The purpose of a public blockchain is for mining and cryptocurrency exchanging.
\n\n <b>Example: Bitcoin, Ethereum </b> \n\n

<b>2. Private Blockchain</b> - It is a centralized platform with some restrictions and permissions to join the network. These Blockchains are usually used within an enterprise and organization. The purpose of private Blockchain is voting, supply chain management, digital identity, asset ownership, etc.
\n\nExample: Hyperledger, Corda \n\n

<b>3. Hybrid Blockchain</b> - It is a combination of both public and private blockchain. This Hybrid Blockchain gives businesses the flexibility to choose what data they want to make public and what data to keep private
'''
question15 = "Is Blockchain Hackable or Not Hackable"
answer15 = "The codes in Blockchain will be embedded in Digital code and stored in a shared database that protects the data from deletion, tampering, and modification. Though Blockchain is a very influential technology, it is not entirely immune to attacks."

question16 = "What is Blockchain Consensus Algorithms"
answer16 = "Consensus Algorithm, the core part of any blockchain network.  This Consensus Algorithm is responsible for verifying the transaction, balance, and signature. There are different types of Algorithm, the most important implementations are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (Pos)"

question17 = "What is Proof of Work"
answer17 = "Producing a proof of work involves solving a mathematical puzzle, this puzzle is solved by the miners and the one who finds the solution will get the miner reward. The process of including the Blocks of blockchain needs high computing power and electricity"

question18 = "What is Proof of Stake"
answer18 = "The Proof of Stake replaces miners with validators, and ask validator to hold up certain coins as stake. In proof of stack, a validator can validate the transactions depends on the number of cryptocurrencies he/she holds. That is the more bitcoins you own the more bitcoin mining power you have."

question19 = "What are the Key features of Blockchain"
answer19 = '''
<b>Decentralized</b> - No central authority to monitor, instead, all your activities will be stored in a public distributed ledger
\n\n
<b>Enhanced Security</b> - All the Information on the Blockchain is hashed cryptographically that is the network will hide the input data through the mathematical puzzles.
\n\n
<b>Distributed Ledger</b> - Every information about the transaction and participants are distributed to every node in the blockchain network.
\n\n
<b>Consensus Algorithm </b>- This Consensus Algorithm is responsible for verifying the transaction, balance, and signature.
'''

question20 = "How Does Blockchain Work"
answer20 = '''
Initially, the node starts a transaction by signing it with a private key via cryptography.\n\n
Once the transaction is validated it is included in blocks called the genesis block.\n\n
The new block will become a part of the ledger. \n\n
whenever the new block is added, the transaction will be reconfirmed\n\n
Six confirmations are required in a network to consider the transaction final.
'''

question21 = "Is there any restriction that only a particular industry should utilize Blockchain"
answer21 = "Blockchain, the Irrevocable technology having its flag of victory in various industries ranging from Solar Energy, Railway, Agriculture, Education, to Various Supply chains. Hence there is no restriction that only a particular industry should utilize Blockchain"

question22 = "What is a cryptocurrency"
answer22 = "Cryptocurrency is basically a virtual exchange medium that uses a cryptography in order to secure its transactions and control the creation of the system units.\n Meaning, cryptocurrency simply represents money in the digital marketplace nothing else. It is based on an open-source software, cryptography and networking. It lets people or users avoid fees or the lowest fees as compared to what your banks are charging. \nThe system takes part in the non-cash transactions that is anonymous while guaranteeing a secure transactions."

question23 = "Why use cryptocurrency"
answer23 = '''
Basically, cryptocurrencies are known for its extreme security and anonymity to the highest level. Transactions made by this system cannot be reversed nor faked and compared to what your local bank are doing in its client charging high transaction fees. \nIn cryptocurrency the fees are to the lowest level, making it reliable than the conventional currency in the marketplace. Its decentralized nature means they can be available to everyone, in which banks can only be available to those they permitted to open accounts.
\n\n
Cryptocurrency is a new generation cash, the cryptocurrency marketplace known this that currency that could take off high value even overnight. But same works the other way around. People who invest on cryptocurrencies must be aware on its volatility in the market and the possible risk when buying it.
\n\n
The high level of anonymity of cryptocurrencies make experts think that they are associated with the illegal activities on the digital marketplace, this is more to say specifically on dark web. Users should take extra careful when choosing currencies to keep.
'''

question24 = "How many cryptocurrencies exist in the web"
answer24 = "There is no exact number of existing cryptocurrencies exist in the ecosystem, this is because the code of the cryptocurrency is an open source, this means that anyone has the chance to create their own version of cryptocurrency by just using the code. \n But as to this moment, the estimated cryptocurrencies in the marketplace is about more than 900, along with the data embedded on them, which can be seen on the list of registered coins."

question25 = "What was the first cryptocurrency"
answer25 = "The first cryptocurrency that was recorded in the digital data was bitcoin, created in the late 2009 and still as of now the best cryptocurrency known in the marketplace. A creation of cryptocurrencies has started emerging in the past decade and now more than 1000 cryptocurrencies can be found on the internet." 

question26 = "What are the most common cryptocurrencies"
answer26 = '''
<b>1. Bitcoin:</b>This cryptocurrency was the first in the ecosystem and the most commonly traded cryptocurrency until today. In 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin, a mysterious digit who developed blockchain. For the record it has a market capitalization of $45 billion dated 2017 of July.\n\n
<b>2. Ethereum:</b> 2015 is the year Ethereum was born, a token based currency used in Ethereum blockchain, it is placed in the second in rank on the most valuable and popular cryptocurrency in the marketplace. 
\nEthereum has market capitalization of $18 Billion as of 2017 of July. Ethereum had a very turbulent journey. After a major hole causing it to be hacked in 2016, as result it split into two currencies, the value of Ethereum in recent months has reached high as $400 but crashed to as low as 10 cents.\n\n
<b>3. Ripple:</b> a cryptocurrency uses a distributed ledger and it was created in 2012. Ripple has a feature to track the type of transaction made, not just cryptocurrency. Ripple has been used by UBS and Sandander, it has more than $6.3 billion market capitalization.\n\n
<b>4. Litecoin:</b> Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that is similarity with bitcoin, but move quickly on its developments, this includes more faster payments and processes more transaction at a time. The estimated overall value of Litecoin is more than $2.1 billion.\n\n

question27 = "What is alternative currency"
answer27 = "A cryptocurrency is an alternative way if you want to transact something besides from the use of international or national currency. This currency is created by individual, organization or corporation, it can also be created by national, local or even state governments, or they can simply arise naturally as people agreed to use them as their common currency in the marketplace."

question28 = "Is it that difficult to obtain cryptocurrency coin"
answer28 = '''
This depends on some factors. But in general, if the kind of cryptocurrency was just recently introduced in the marketplace, the computing power needed in order to mine the coin is obviously low compared to the highly established crypto currency in the market.\n

<b>These are list wherein you can acquire cryptocurrency coin.</b>\n

• Accept payment for a certain goods and services offered in the market.\n

• Purchasing specific coins on legitimate exchangers online.\n

• By simply exchanging coins to someone you know or some that is near you.\n

• Earning it by simply mining.\n
'''

question29 = "What is Cryptocurrency Mining"
answer29 = '''
Mining any type of cryptocurrencies basically needs powerful hardware and the right software. The value of the currency highly depends on the units available in the marketplace, they are carefully monitored in a very accurate process. Mining cryptocurrency is the process of generating units in the cryptocurrency.
\n\n
To understand better, let us assume a large economy with billions of dollars in banks altogether. Now, since this situation is not physically possible for them to store these currency notes in banks, so they store it in a digital format with central reserve bank. The reserve bank then maintains a digital record of what it was owed to bank but doesn’t keep the notes in physical form. So whenever it needs to push money into the system and short of its notes, they will be printed and issued.
\n\n
Despite the fact that the reserved bank has the capability to print as many notes, it does not do without a valid reason. This is because when more currency is printed, more money is circulated in the market, therefore this will not make people richer, this will only devalue the existing currency. The more the units in the market the more it is divided and it becomes less.
\n\n
The situation is the same when it comes to cryptocurrency, the mining of cryptocurrency is monitored carefully to ensure the value of existing coins will not depreciate.\n
'''

question30 = "Why should I get involved in cryptocurrency"
answer30 = '''
Because most people believed that it is profitable. Anyone has the option to mine its coins or simply invest into them. The expanding ecosystem provide a multiple opportunities on the possibility of doubling or even more your current assets.
\n\n
What was more convincing was that, cryptocurrency value are evaluated constantly and then re-evaluated as more people join the network. At beginning, cryptocurrency revolution was at 100$ initial investment that could brought hundreds or even thousand profits. Till date, this kind of opportunity is still available.
'''

question31 = "What is a cryptocurrency wallet"
answer31 = '''
This is all about storing a cryptocurrency, wallet concept can be daunting a bit for the uninitiated. Basically, there are wallet software (this can be desktop, online or mobile), hardware based wallets, and of course the paper wallets. Talking about the “best” wallet in the ecosystem will be different for each one of us, it depends on a particular needs.
\n\n
Wallets don’t just store cryptocurrency directly. It is accurate to think wallet as storing private keys. The Public key cryptography allows cryptocurrency to function, and uses a specific algorithms in order to generate pairs of keys. Public key is the address to which anyone can send its cryptocurrency balance. The private key allows owners spend funds from the specified address. Without the private key, public address becomes bottomless pit that you can only see; money still be sent there, but lost without a private key.
\n\n
The type of wallets simply represents various ways a certain can secure their secret private key. There are two main types of cryptocurrency wallet, the hot and cold, these refers to the level or internet connectivity of the wallet. Paper wallet and hardware wallets are not actively connected to internet and considered as cold storage. Hot wallet is internet connected wallet, easy to spend, but vulnerable to cyber-attacks. A cold storage protects you from cyber-crime, but still it will be the owner’s responsibility to secure their property.\n\n
'''

question32 = "What is cryptocurrency exchange and market"
answer32 = "A cryptocurrency market and exchange are both service in web, allowing cryptoccurrency token holder to trade to other currency or conventional monetary to their system. According to record, there are more than 2000 cryptocurrency exchangers in the ecosystem, among the largest are Bitstamp, Cryptsy, and Coinbase."

question33 = "How is the cryptocurrency value determined"
answer33 = "The value of cryptocurrencies are ranked in a value or unit times and the cost of exchange to buy equals the capitalization in the market. For instance 1 Waves coin is worth $9.50 on Binance this rate was in the previous month. But the price can move at any moment, the market capitalization is only an estimate of the overall value of the digital currency."

question34 = "What are the exciting reason for you to get involved with the digital currency"
answer34 = '''
With the ability to immediately transfer cash in just a matter of seconds to anyone around the globe from its wallet without having any fees or at lowest rate. Digital currencies enables spending and receiving money 20 times easier compared to your traditional wire transfer, western union and Paypal.
\n\n
The digital currencies are just like real cash, meaning this can be used to merchants that received this kind of currency that you are holding, some merchants prefer to receive cryptocurrencies. Because in in cryptocurrency ones the payment is send, there is no chances the sender can get it back compared to PayPal or Strip in which customer can perform chargeback in which merchants loose the funds.
\n\n
There is a higher possibilities that in the near future, all transaction will be done in a user to user system with the help of cryptocurrencies.\n
'''

question35 = "What will be the worst part about cryptocurrencies"
answer35 = '''
Like any other reasons on the digital world, losing your password or make mistake in your transaction then you will lose your funds or the account itself forever with no chance of getting it back. Cryptocurrencies are extremely serious and there’s no second chance at all, so make sure to take extra careful to everything you do with your wallet. Once locked then it’s a good bye to your account. \nTo make worse, your cryptocurrency wallet are easy to rob compared to a what bank has. For instance your wallet is open on a computer then anyone has access with it, your overall balance could be washed out without any trace.
\n\n
Even Law enforcement at less than NSA level is not able to help out unless the thief itself is sloppy beyond belief because of its convenience of moving the funds to any cryptocurrency through anonymous transaction makes tracking nearly impossible to those individual that has no access to the real time worldwide electronic monitoring system which is no one is going to allow use in case of a stolen cryptocurrency.
'''

question36 = "Which cryptocurrency is the best to date"
answer36 = "The best cryptocurrency to purchase is the one that you want to hold on, whether the value goes down and goes up. I believe Bitcoin, Ethereum, Waves, Lumens, ADA are the types of crypto that I am willing to hold even if it totally goes down and will buy more eventually when the price goes really down. \n I don’t have any intention to sell these tokens and continue to invest in the long term because I believed that there are community behind it. One more thing focus on the established one. And only invest to what you can afford to lose."

question37 = "Is there a fake cryptocurrency"
answer37 = "Bitcoin or BTC, the first every cryptocurrency in the digital marketplace, has gone from its media sensation to quite a few years. But upon its wake, an estimate of more than 800 new cryptocurrencies sprung in the digital market, just like mushrooms after a strong thunderstorm. \n\nOnly a few Bitcoin alternatives can be considered legit. All others can be considered as just a traditional mushroom which was used mainly as food."

question38 = "Is Cryptocurrency Legal"
answer38 = '''
It is very much understandable to have this question regarding its legality, e.g. using Bitcoin or BTC. This platform introduced a new paradigm which is away from traditional regulations and regulators that is govern by the fiat currency.
\n\n
Not like counterfeit money, illegal, which is blatant example of “currency” that slants as legal, tender. But BTC is totally different. It operates in an ostensibly gray area when talking about regulation. But all of these issues boil down due to lack of rules that governs a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. rather than the blatant law violation.
\n\n
All the questions regarding cryptocurrencies and the law depends on how these digital currency in the ecosystem are being utilized in the marketplace.
\n\n
For instance, Bitcoin regulators have been concerned with its semi-anonymity and its decentralized nature in the digital marketplace. Not just in United States but the same situation towards other countries, authorities fear that the system could be used or already been used for such money laundering activities and purchase of these forbidden goods without having traced.
\n\n
These activity are not helping out Bitcoin’s reputation with establishments that was prevalence of using it as major payment services in the digital marketplace, in which customers purchase illegal goods. Whether people uses Bitcoin or not as long as you are doing illegal activities it’s always be illegal. The issue here is the illegality of the activity, whether you paid something in cash, gold, Bitcoin, or any other forms of currency.
\n\n
According to U.S. Treasury department Network. As 2013, purchasing well natured goods and services using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not illegal. But those people or organization who mine Bitcoins and then trade them for a traditional currency or establish an exchange services on which BTC are bought and sold are then labelled as money transmitter and could subject to a special laws govern by that activity.
\n\n
The legality of these cryptocurrencies, for instance Bitcoin is viewed differently by experts, but one thing that is sure, as long as it is not connected to any illicit activities, then you don’t have to worry about it. These cryptocurrencies do not exist on the list of sanctioned list currencies, its status could somewhat place a user at risk but no violation of any laws.
'''

question39 = "What is the main difference between tokens and cryptocurrencies"
answer39 = '''
From what most people define, when we talk about currency, this is a generally accepted form of money, this can be paper notes, coins, which is naturally issued by the government and then circulated in the economy.
\n\n
Cryptocurrency on the other hand is not that different from tokens. These tokens are issued by enthusiastic developers and someone in the community bought it (or received it for something in return) and can obviously trade them, then it becomes a cryptocurrency.
\n\n
But, these tokens are more than just a cryptocurrency. They can be used in some cases in the operation of smart contracts in the network that accepts the specific token. Let us say for instance, BAT or the Basic Attention Tokens are used in advertising related service. This means that BAT value are useful for those who want to increase their engagement and will buy this type of token.
\n\n
So therefore, cryptocurrencies helps the transfer of value in the community that accepts it and function as what a physical money does, as token this can be used for some cases in the blockchain.
'''

question40 = "What is the difference between cryptocurrency and digital currency"
answer40 = '''
Like US dollar and most currencies in the world would qualify as a digital currency. Because only a little of them exist as a physical bills. When the community is talking about them “creating” more money. What they just actually did was to ad numbers in the system.
\n\n
A cryptocurrency is extremely secured cryptography, in which dollars are secured by, nothing really. Governments and banks can make money when they feel like making one, and rules should be applied on the amount of funds to be created, but in reality of life, there’s no limit at all.
\n\n
As holder, you need to trust entities to transfer digital currency any time using your WU, Wire transfer, debit card, check, money-gram or just anything other than cash. They can manipulate or stop your transfer, or take your money, or fail to deliver if they feel like the transaction was incompetent.
\n\n
A cryptocurrency uses a cryptography in order secure every transfers so the function of third party will not be needed anymore, because transfer can be directly send to the receiver without any interception from other.
